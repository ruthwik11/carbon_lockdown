# Carbon Lockdown

## Introduction
Carbon Lockdown is a new research organization that aims to educate the general public about carbon sequestration and how it can help us fight climate change. In this project, we are developing the website for the organization that will contain all the information about their work. The website will include news, articles, and other information related to carbon sequestration that will educate people and raise their awareness on this topic.

*Note - The website is currently being developed.
